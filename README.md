## Description
For all music fans, Cover Collection is the best way to organize your favorite album covers into a single, personalized collection.
Cover Collection gives you the ability to:

- Collect any album artwork from the Apple Music Catalog into a gorgeous, customizable collection
- Reorder album covers to match your style
- Access your music library to play music directly in Cover Collection, without leaving the app
- Seamlessly toggle between light and dark mode
- Screenshot your collection to use as your wallpaper or create poster prints (via third party)
- Introduce yourself! Music taste says a lot about a person. Compare your collection with people you meet as a unique ice breaker.
- Be yourself. Cover Collection is the first app on the App Store that allows you to organize your favorite album covers into a gorgeous, personalized collection.

## Prerequisites
Cover Collection is an iOS Application that is designed to run on iOS devices running iOS 13+ and Macs with Apple silicon.

## Installing and Testing
Cover Collection is available on the iOS App Store. It can be downloaded directly from your iOS device running iOS 13+ [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cover-collection/id1448067875). Testing of this application can be done in the Xcode iOS Simulator. Download all project files onto a Mac running macOS Mojave or later.

## Development Process
Cover Collection is my debut app for the App Store. I came up with the idea for Cover Collection when I came across the burden of creating an album art collage through word processing applications on my laptop. This is my solution for other music lovers to create their own personal collage of their favorite album artwork easily. Cover Collection was designed, developed, and tested in Xcode 10.2. It uses native iOS Frameworks including [Foundation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation) and [UIKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit) to build a main UICollectionVIew, UITableView, and a navigation view controller for a seamless user experience. This application decodes JSON using Swift 3 syntax. The JSON data is pulled directly from the [iTunes API](https://affiliate.itunes.apple.com/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api/) and stored into custom Swift types.

## Authors
This application was designed, developed, and tested entirely and solely by Sam Blum. At the time of this publication, Sam Blum is a 19 year old rising sophomore studying Computer Science at Vanderbilt University. He began teaching himself the Swift Programming Language for designing native iOS Apps during the second semester of his senior year of high school in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and is now a registered [Apple Developer](https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/sam-blum/id1448067874). He continued learning how to code when he took his first Java programming course at Vanderbilt in the Spring of his freshman year. He plans to continue learning C++ and Python this year.

## Acknowledgments
This is my first completely self-built iOS App, and it was a long road to get here. There were obstacles but it's in these times of failure that we learn the most and truly shine. I'd like to thank Apple for giving creatives the opportunity to display their work to the world and as always for their extremely helpful resources on learning the fundamentals of Swift and Xcode. Additionally I'd like to thank the entire developer community for always being repsonsive to online forums and personal DMs on Twitter. And finally I'd like to thank my family for always pushing me to continue learning and developing even when it gets tough.
Regardless of how Cover Collection performs on the App Store, I plan on creating and deploying many more apps for years to come.
